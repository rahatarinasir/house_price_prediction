 house price prediction
Linear Regression: Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used regression algorithm in machine learning. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features (such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.) and the target variable, which in this case is the price of a house. By fitting a linear equation to the training data, linear regression can estimate the relationship between the features and the house prices, enabling predictions for unseen houses.

Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is a variant of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization. By adding a penalty term to the loss function, lasso regression encourages the model to select a smaller subset of features by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant or less important features to zero. This can help in feature selection and prevent overfitting, making the model more interpretable and robust for house price prediction.

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is another variant of linear regression that applies L2 regularization. Similar to lasso regression, it adds a penalty term to the loss function. However, instead of eliminating irrelevant features, ridge regression shrinks the coefficients of all features towards zero, but without setting them exactly to zero. This can help in reducing the impact of multicollinearity (high correlation between features) and improving the model's generalization ability for predicting house prices.

Categorical Regression: Categorical regression techniques are commonly used when the target variable is categorical or discrete. However, for house price prediction, the target variable is typically a continuous variable. Therefore, categorical regression models may not be directly applicable in this context. Instead, regression models, such as linear regression or tree-based models, can be used to predict the numerical values of house prices based on various input features.

XGBoost Regressor: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful gradient boosting framework that combines multiple decision trees to create an ensemble model for regression tasks. XGBoost regressor is well-suited for house price prediction as it can handle both numerical and categorical features, capture complex relationships, and provide high performance. By leveraging the boosting technique, XGBoost can iteratively improve the model's prediction accuracy by focusing on the houses that are harder to predict.

XGBoost Light: XGBoost Light, also known as LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), is a fast and memory-efficient gradient boosting framework. Similarly to XGBoost, it is suitable for house price prediction tasks. LightGBM offers various advanced features such as histogram-based gradient boosting, leaf-wise tree growth, and efficient handling of missing data. These features enable accurate predictions, even with large-scale datasets, making it a valuable choice for house price prediction.

These models can be utilized for house price prediction by training them on historical data that includes various features related to houses (e.g., number of rooms, location, proximity to amenities, etc.). The trained models can then be used to predict the price of new or unseen houses based on their features, assisting in real estate valuation and decision-making processes.
